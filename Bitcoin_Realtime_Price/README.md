Description:

The Bitcoin Price Tracker is a Flutter-based mobile application developed during my Bachelor's in 2023. This project was my introduction to working with APIs, where I successfully integrated a Bitcoin API to fetch and display real-time data. The app features:

Real-Time Bitcoin Price: Displays the current price of Bitcoin.

Price Change Percentage: Tracks percentage changes in Bitcoin prices over hourly, weekly, and daily intervals.

User-Friendly Interface: Designed to provide a seamless experience for users monitoring Bitcoin trends.

Technologies Used:

Flutter: Frontend framework for building the mobile app.

API Integration: Learned to connect to external APIs and process JSON data.

This project significantly enhanced my understanding of API integration and real-time data handling in mobile application development.
